Systems integration via platform agnostics.\r\n2. Demonstrates systems integration and platform agnostics by linking together,\r\n      * Different computing systems (CPU+OS) and,\r\n      * Software application languages (C, C++, Java etc.,).\r\n3. To exchange various types of data (i.e., Values, Events, Alarms, Commands, Streams) coordinated between publishers and subscribers over LAN and/or WAN.\r\n\r\n## Visibility into system:\r\n* Publisher and Subscriber match analysis, \r\n* QoS offered and requested between publishers and subscribers,\r\n* Data and Metadata statistics.\r\n  \r\n## Demo Architecture: \r\nVarious sensors (ultrasonic/barometric) and stepper motors connected with Raspberry Pi (ARM + Linux) exchanging data with discrete platforms (x86/Win, x86/Linux, ARM/Android) and application languages (Java, C, C++ and LabView). \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
