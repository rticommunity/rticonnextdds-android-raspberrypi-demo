Systems integration via platform agnostics.\r\n2. Demonstrates systems integration and platform agnostics by linking together,\r\n      * Different computing systems (CPU+OS) and,\r\n      * Software application languages (C, C++, Java etc.,).\r\n3. To exchange various types of data (i.e., Values, Events, Alarms, Commands, Streams) coordinated between publishers and subscribers over LAN and/or WAN.\r\n\r\n## Visibility into system:\r\n* Publisher and Subscriber match analysis, debugging, host identification,\r\n* QoS offered and requested between publishers and subscribers, \r\n* Data and metadata exchange and communication statics, middleware and application performance, system snapshot.\r\n  \r\n## Demo architecture: \r\nVarious sensors (ultrasonic/barometric) and stepper motors connected with Raspberry Pi (ARM + Linux) exchanging data with discrete platforms (x86/Win, x86/Linux, ARM/Android) and application languages (Java, C, C++ and LabView). \r\n\r\n![Demo configurations.](http://community.rti.com/sites/default/files/users/Ashish/screen_shot_2014-10-15_at_18.00.59.png)\r\n\r\n## System software and configuration\r\n* [RASPBIAN OS (Wheezy)](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/).\r\n* [RTI Connext DDS 5.1.0 Libraries for Raspberry Pi](http://community.rti.com/downloads/rti-connext-dds-raspberry-pi).\r\n* [Raspberry Pi GPIO Setup](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruits-raspberry-pi-lesson-4-gpio-setup/configuring-gpio).\r\n\r\n## Bill of materials\r\n* Barometric Temperature, Pressure and Altitude Sensor BMP180 or BMP085.\r\n* Ultrasonic sensor SRF05. \r\n* 2 x Stepper motors 28BYJ-48.\r\n* Raspberry Pi Model B with 512MB RAM.\r\n* Google Nexus 7 tablet (UI might need adjustments for different screen sizes)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
