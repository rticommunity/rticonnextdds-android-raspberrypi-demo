======================================
What problem does it solve:
  
  1. Systems integration via platform agnostics, a process of bringing together discrete systems utilizing a variety of techniques and component subsystems, and ensuring
      that the subsystems function together as a single system.
  
  2. Demonstrates systems integration and platform agnostics by linking together,
      a. Different computing systems (CPU+OS) and,
      b. Software application languages (C, C++, Java etc.,).

  3. To exchange various types of data (i.e., Values, Events, Alarms, Commands, Streams) coordinated between publishers and subscribers.

Visibility into system:
      Publisher and Subscriber match analysis, 
      QoS offered and requested between publishers and subscribers,
      Data and Metadata statistics.


Demo Architecture: 
Various sensors (ultrasonic/barometric) and stepper motors connected with Raspberry Pi (ARM + Linux) exchanging data with discrete platforms (x86/Win, x86/Linux, ARM/Android) and application languages (Java, C, C++ and LabView).
